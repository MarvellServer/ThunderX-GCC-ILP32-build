# Below is an example of how to invoke runcpu. See cpu2017_tx2_gcc10
# for more explanation of the "--define" arguments that are used for
# controlling behavior defined in the config file. For the other
# arguments see the details at https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/makevars.html
# After the runcpu command are descriptions for the ones used.

runcpu --rebuild --define smt=4 --define gcc_dir=/opt/gcc-tot-ilp32-tmp \
  --iterations 1 --noreportable --configfile cpu2017_tx2_gcc10_pass4.cfg \
  --define bits=32 --define sockets=2 --tune all --nopower \
  --runmode rate --tune base:peak --size refrate intrate

#
--rebuild -- delete existing binaries and rebuild
--iterations 1 -- how many times to run each benchmark
--noreportable -- don't as much as possible, check/enforce SPECCPU2017 run rules
--configfile cpu2017_tx2_gcc10_pass4.cfg -- configure using named file in config
--tune all -- select tuning to use: base, peak, or all
--nopower -- enable/disable optional power measurement
--runmode rate -- sets mode to rate or speed NB: not documented
--size -- should be test, train, or ref. Default is ref.
refrate intrate -- workloads/benchmarks to run.
  refrate => run reference, intrate => run int base and peak

# Note: the example runcpu was extracted from the generated config file
# http://sm2650-2s-01.caveonetworks.com/dbresults/Pipeline_DB_speccpu2017_physical/605/results/CPU2017.001.intrate.refrate.cfg
# It appears there may some discrepancy between what is documented and what 
# is accepted and/or generated. Examples:
# --configfile appears in the doc as --config
# --runmode not documented
# --size requires test, train, or ref
