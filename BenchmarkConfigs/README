Policies for maintaining benchmark configurations.

The "main" branch should contain the "best" configuration so far for the
benchmark that is being run. For example, because SPECCPU2017 can
contain configurations for different ways of running, a single file
per processor and compiler can suffice.

When experimenting with configurations that one wants to share/and or
preserve, create a branch with a descriptive name and make a new version
of the "golden" configuration file there.

When an improvement to the "golden" file is made, include in the commit
comment the new performance numbers.

For SPECCPU2017 "golden" file will/should be: cpu2017_tx2_gcc10 and it is
used in combination with gcc-arm.xml.
